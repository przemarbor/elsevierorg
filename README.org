* Elsevier LaTeX in Org-Mode

This is the modification of the template authored by Lucas M. Schnorr.
It introduces =org-cite= - [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Citations.html][a convenient way of handling citations]]
and presents different ways of refering to manuscript items like floats, bibliography entries etc.


The [[https://www.elsevier.com/authors/author-schemas/latex-instructions][Elsevier LaTeX template]] in Org-Mode, just type make.  Be aware
that this example is compatible with OrgMode 9.*. We won't recommend
use with earlier versions.  For a detailed explanation on why and how
to write reproducible articles using OrgMode, please visit the
following [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/blob/master/1_replicable_article_laboratory_notebook/index.org][page]].
